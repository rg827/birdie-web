Final Project

Learnings:

(1) Developing an app that incorporates a back-end with sign-in, database, third-party API, and my own algorithm

(2) Gained practice using data from Firebase and user-uploaded data (e.g. storing data from both into objects/arrays and working with the combined data to make analyses)


Technical Hurdles:
 (1) Comparing data structures for like data (solution: used Underscore.JS for the first time)

 (2) Getting a user's selection from a drop down

 (3) Developing an algorithm to display quality data (though still a prototype system)
